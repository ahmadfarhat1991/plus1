# Add-1

## Description

Based on a task from
["Thinking, Fast and Slow" by Daniel Kahneman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow"):

> To start, make up several strings of 4 digits, all different,
and write each string on an index card. Place a blank card on top of the deck.
The task that you will perform is called Add-1. Here is how it goes:
Start beating a steady rhythm (or better yet, set a metronome at 1/sec).
Remove the blank card and read the four digits aloud.
Wait for two beats, then report a string in which each of the original
digits is incremented by 1. If the digits on the card are 5294,
the correct response is 6305. Keeping the rhythm is important.
